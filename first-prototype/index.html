<h2>Interstellar Fight</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Add a pause function to the game. The palyer can move up and down. I make the enemy bullet larger than the original to make the game more challenge for players. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game technology is simple which is basic moving. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to clone the works to local and upgrade the works on github from local, 
and some basic logic how the Phaser is working. 
The easiest part of this work is change the elements. 
The hardest part of this work is trying to figure out the arangement of texts and sprites.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
I find all the assets from a open source website called <a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart</a><ul>

<li>Background image: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/starfield-alpha-4k">starfield-alpha-4k</a></li>
<li>Spaceship & bullet image: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux">pace-shooter-redux</a></li>

The main player strategy is focus on more than the player itself(it is the jet in the game), and also see the enemy 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
