<h2>Interstellar Fight</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Add a pause function to the game. The palyer can move up and down. I make the enemy bullet larger than the original to make the game more challenge for players. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game technology is simple which is basic moving. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to clone the works to local and upgrade the works on github from local, 
and some basic logic how the Phaser is working. 
The easiest part of this work is change the elements. 
The hardest part of this work is trying to figure out the arangement of texts and sprites. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
I find all the assets from a open source website called <a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart</a></ul>
<ul>
<li>Background image: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/starfield-alpha-4k">starfield-alpha-4k</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
I choose the game from Phaser example called <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/invaders">Invaders</a>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a game let player to control the jet, aviod the bullet sot by the alien jet and attack the all the alien jets. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
In 2077, the aliens from a star far away is trying to occupy Earth, as the guardian of the earth, you have to protect our planet! 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The main control of the game is the keyboard, use up, down, left and right to control the jet fly, and use space to fire, player can also click on the pause button to pause the game and unpause by click it again. The bullet shot by the enemy is randomly, player should aviod the attack. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To build the main part of the whole game. Start from this frototype, the rest prototypes and the whole game will be multiple checkpoints, and become more and more difficult. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Feels satisfied when distroy the enemy or clean up all the enemies.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This is a game which let player attack the enemies. When the game start, player will have three chances(live) to kill all the enemies. Each enemy killed will give player 20 points. Once all the enemies have been killed, the player will have 1000 extra points. The points will be useful for the future game use. 
The control of the game is the keyborad and mouse. Player can use up, down, left and right to control the jet, and use space on the keyboard to fire. Player also can use the mouse to click on the pause button to pause the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main player strategy is focus on more than the player itself(it is the jet in the game), and also see the enemies' fire. 
</li>
